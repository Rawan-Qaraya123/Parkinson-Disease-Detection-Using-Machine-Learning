# Parkinson-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project detects Parkinson's disease using spiral and wave drawings. Machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning (CNN, ResNet-50) were used. Data augmentation improved training on limited data. Models were evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
